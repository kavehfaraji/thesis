            <h3>Overall Summary:</h3>
            <p> Based on the literature of customer churn research, it can be understood that the issue of predicting
                customer churn is vital for telecommunications companies. Predicting customer churn enables
                decision-makers to identify potential churners more quickly and make better decisions about them using
                appropriate strategies. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent model based on ensemble learning is
                proposed for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The research results
                demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the best predictive models in terms of customer
                churn prediction. If a decision-maker needs to determine which customers are likely to churn or not, the
                proposed algorithm can reliably predict customer churn. The computational achievement in this study is
                significant, as the proposed model outperforms other models in the majority of relevant indicators in
                the research literature. Additionally, the NCA method is utilized to reduce dimensions and identify the
                most effective features for classification. Furthermore, considering the challenges in creating ensemble
                models, the proposed model in this study is created by simultaneously considering two criteria,
                accuracy, and diversity, using the genetic algorithm optimization method with non-dominated sorting.
                Moreover, to address the issue of imbalance dataset, a performance evaluation index is suggested for
                classification, which considers the accuracy of classification in all classes. This index assists the
                optimization algorithm in selecting a set of classifiers capable of correctly classifying the available
                samples in all classes.To create diversity in classifiers and divide the training data, an incremental
                clustering method is utilized.</p>

            <p>This method causes the training set to be divided into diverse and dissimilar clusters. The
                incremental
                property of this clustering method allows the proposed model to examine all feature spaces. Firstly, the
                training set is divided into different clusters through clustering. Then, the identical clusters and
                clusters consisting of samples from a single class (atomic clusters) are removed. In the next step, five
                classifiers, namely Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
                k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB), are trained on the remaining clusters. Thus, a set of
                diverse base classifiers is obtained. Subsequently, using the NSGA-II optimization algorithm while
                considering two objectives, diversity and accuracy, a set of classifiers will be selected from the
                trained classifiers. These selected classifiers will have the highest level of diversity while being
                capable of accurately classifying the data. The novelty of this research lies in the utilization of new
                techniques such as ensemble learning and evolutionary computation to enhance the prediction accuracy
                in customer churn for the telecommunications industry. Additionally, the diversity evaluation index
                proposed in this research differs from the existing indices in the literature in terms of computational
                aspects. Previous indices measure the diversity of two classifiers based on their classification
                accuracy and error. However, the proposed index in this research evaluates diversity solely based on the
                difference between the predicted classes by the classifiers.

            <h3>Dataset:</h3>
            <p>
                The research utilizes a dataset extracted randomly from the database of an Iranian telecommunications
                company over a 12-month period. The dataset consists of a total of 3,150 records, each belonging to a
                customer, along with 12 feature columns. The dataset features include incomplete calls, number of
                complaints, duration of customer-operator communication, charged credit amount, duration of calls made,
                number of received calls, number of sent text messages, number of different contacted numbers, customer
                age, type of service plan used by the customer, and customer status.
                Furthermore, the dataset exhibits an imbalance with a churned customer ratio of 15.7%. The dataset is
                accessible in the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset">UCI</a>
                database.
            </p>
            <h3>Multi-Objective Evolutionary Ensemble based on Clustering:</h3>
            <p>
                Diversity is a basic concept in the formation of ensemble classifications. To form an ensemble
                classification, a set of different and diverse classifiers is needed. Diversity metrics mentioned in the
                literature have a relationship with classification accuracy in terms of measuring the diversity
                of two classifiers based on the number of correctly predicted samples with prediction errors. These
                metrics compare the predictions of each classifier against the true class labels and measure the
                diversity of these comparisons. However, it should be noted that these metrics do not fully capture the
                actual difference between two classifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reason, the proposed model utilizes a novel method for evaluating diversity among base
                classifiers, which captures the difference between the predictions of two classifiers without
                considering classification accuracy. This approach ensures that increasing the value of this diversity
                index in an ensemble model does not lead to a decrease in classification accuracy. Therefore, there is
                no single solution that can simultaneously optimize both objectives, and instead, a set of solutions
                exists. These solutions are referred to as non-dominated or Pareto-optimal solutions. In the proposed
                method, using the II-NSGA algorithm and considering both diversity and accuracy metrics, a set of
                ensemble classifiers is created on the Pareto-optimal frontier.
            </p>
            <h3>The proposed diversity index:</h3>
            <p>
                When we talk about the difference between two objects, we are essentially looking for characteristics or
                features that, although both objects possess them, differ in their type or value. For example, the
                difference between two tables could be the length of their legs, or the difference between two cats
                could be the variation in their fur color. However, when examining the difference between two
                classifiers, the only feature we can study to measure their dissimilarity is the type of class predicted
                by each classifier.<br>
                Suppose dataset X consists of seven samples, and the class set includes three classes {a,b,c}. The
                corresponding true classes for this dataset are as follows.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="1.jpg" alt="X dataset">
            </div>
            <p>
                Now, if the predictions of two classifiers, c1 and c2, for the samples of dataset X are as shown in the
                table below:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="2.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <p>
                In that case, the values of the following five diversity indices are calculated in the following order:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="3.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The Q statistic</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="4.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The correlation coefficient ρ:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="5.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The disagreement measure:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="6.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The double-fault measure:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="7.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>Interrater Agreement:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="8.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <p>
                Based on the calculations above, it can be concluded that none of the above diversity indices accurately
                capture the difference between the two classifiers. This is despite the fact that classifiers C1 and C2
                agree with each other on at least three sample predictions. Therefore, in the proposed
                method, an attempt has been made to calculate the difference between the two classifiers without
                considering the correctness or incorrectness of their predictions.Accordingly, a comparative function
                (f(x)) is used to measure the difference between the two
                classifiers, and the value of this function is calculated by the following equation:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="9.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <p>
                The values of this function can be stored in a matrix as shown below, where rows with a value of 1
                indicate the samples for which the predictions of the two classifiers differ in their assigned class,
                and zero values indicate similarity in the predictions of the two classifiers for that sample.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="10.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <p>Now, if we represent the number of samples in the dataset as N, the difference between the two
                classifiers can be calculated using the following equation:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="11.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                where "n" is equal to the index of the last sample in the dataset, the diversity for
                the two classifiers in this example would be 4/7 = 0.572. Now, let's consider a ensemble model
                consisting of 5 different classifiers.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="12.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                In this case, we need to apply the comparative function f(x) a total of L(L-1)/2 times, where
                L is the number of classifiers in the ensemble model. In this example, with five classifiers, we will
                perform ten iterations, comparing each classifier with the other classifiers. As a result, we will
                obtain ten comparison matrices, each representing the differences between two
                classifiers
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="13.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                which the value of "Div" for each one is:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="14.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                When the value of the "Div" function is equal to 1, it indicates that the corresponding two classifiers
                are completely different from each other. And when the value is equal to 0, it indicates complete
                similarity
                between the two classifiers. Now, to calculate the overall diversity in a ensemble model, we take the
                average of the "Div" values.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="15.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                In that case, for the given example, the diversity index value would be 0.7285. In the example,
                classifiers C2 and C5 are similar to each other. Therefore, if classifier C5 is removed from the
                ensemble model, the diversity value would increase. In this scenario, we would have:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="16.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>So the value of "Div" would be:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="17.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                This diversity index is used to calculate diversity in a ensemble model. In previous indices, there was
                a mutual relationship between classifier accuracy and diversity. However, with the introduction of the
                new diversity index, this relationship is limited, and the diversity of individual classifiers is
                calculated separately from their accuracy. This leads to a reverse impact on the ensemble classifier
                accuracy when diversity increases. Therefore, in such problems where improving one objective leads to
                deviation in another, there is no single optimal solution that can simultaneously optimize both
                objectives, and in fact, there exists a set of optimal solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this study, the NSGA (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) is used to find an optimal combination
                of classifiers that can outperform other algorithms in terms of both diversity and accuracy. Initially,
                a search space is created consisting of a number of classifiers trained by clustering. Then, the
                optimization algorithm selects a combination of members from this search space to form a ensemble model
                that maximizes diversity and accuracy. In general, the proposed method consists of two stages:
                generating the search space and forming optimal ensemble models. The detailed steps of this method are
                described further in the following sections.
            </p>
            <h3>Generation of search space in MOEEC model:</h3>
            <h4>1. First step, feature selection:</h4>
            <p>
                Not all features in a dataset may have an impact on predicting the class of that dataset. Therefore,
                identifying important features and removing less important ones can facilitate the classification
                process. For this reason, in the proposed model, we initially select a subset of features that can
                maximize the overall classification accuracy. We reduce the dimensionality of the input feature space
                and eliminate irrelevant features.<br>

                To achieve this, the NCA (Neighborhood Component Analysis) method is implemented to calculate the
                weights of the features on the dataset. Then, features with weights lower than a relative loss threshold
                are removed from the dataset. The figure below illustrates the results of feature weighting and
                selection using the NCA algorithm on the investigated dataset.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="18.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <h4>2. Second step, dividing the dataset into training and testing sets:</h4>
            <h4>3. Third step, clustering the training dataset:</h4>
            <p>
                After dimensionality reduction, the training dataset undergoes a repetitive clustering process to create
                subsets within a clustering framework. In the proposed method, a clustering technique is used to create
                random subsets. The clustering method employed in this research is K-means clustering, with the
                difference that the training dataset is clustered multiple times with varying numbers of clusters. All
                resulting clusters in each iteration are stored as samples of the training set.<br>

                In this approach, the number of clusters in K-means is initially set to one in the first iteration,
                effectively creating a single cluster that is equivalent to the dataset itself. In the second iteration,
                the number of clusters, K, is set to two, leading to the division of the dataset into two clusters. This
                process continues, and in each iteration, the dataset is divided into an increased number of clusters.
                This repetition continues for a specified number of iterations.<br>
                As a result, the total number of clusters created and stored in the storage space after n iteration in
                the clustering
                process will be n(n+1)/2. The figure below illustrates the clustering
                process,
                the number of clusters created at each stage, and the total number of clusters after four iterations.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="19.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="20.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                Clustering in this manner ensures that all regions of the feature space are examined. However, a
                potential issue with this approach is that some clusters may become identical or effectively repetitive
                in different stages. Therefore, it is necessary to employ an operator to remove redundant clusters.
                Additionally, due to the imbalanced nature of the data, some clusters after clustering may consist
                entirely of samples belonging to a single class. These clusters are referred to as atomic clusters.
                Training classifiers on these clusters alone would be futile because they only contain samples from a
                single class, and learning from a single class lacks the necessary credibility. Therefore, these types
                of clusters are identified and removed from the cluster set. The remaining clusters are then used to
                train the base classifiers.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="21.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <h4>4. Fourth step, creating a set of base classifiers:</h4>
            <p>
                After discarding atomic clusters and removing redundant clusters, a total of D clusters remain. The
                number of base classifiers trained by each of these clusters is N. Therefore, the total number of
                trained base classifiers will be D multiplied by N (Z=DxN). Due to the differences between the training
                clusters and the variations between the base classifiers with different structures, diversity among the
                trained base classifiers is ensured. The presence of diversity in the set of base classifiers indicates
                the different capabilities of each classifier in predicting test data. Hence, selecting an appropriate
                combination of these classifiers that increases both diversity and the accuracy of the ensemble model is
                essential.

            <h4>2. population initialization</h4>
            <p>
                The space that encompasses all possible solutions to a problem is called the search space.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Fitness function calculation</h4>
            <p>
                In order for an algorithm to be able to search within this space, the fitness of each potential solution
                from the population must be determined. Each chromosome is considered as a point in the search space,
                and the fitness of each individual depends on how well they can solve the problem. The fitness function
                represents the quality of each population member corresponding to each chromosome in the population. The
                fitness function in this study involves two objectives. The proposed algorithm aims to minimize both of
                these objectives.

            <h4>4. Non-dominated sorting and crowding distance calculation</h4>
            <p>
                After calculating the fitness function for the population models based on non-dominated sorting and
                crowding distance, they are sorted. In non-dominated sorting, individuals in the population are ranked
                into different fronts. After sorting the individuals in the population, the distance of each individual
                from its neighboring members in each front is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, individuals with
                higher crowding distances are selected. In general, when comparing two individuals with different ranks,
                preference is given to the one with a lower rank. For two individuals with the same rank, preference is
                given to the one with a higher crowding distance.

            <h4>5. Selection, crossover, and mutation </h4>
            <p>
                In this stage, using the selection, crossover, and mutation operators, a new population is created,
                consisting of the mutated population and the population resulting from crossover. The fitness function
                is then calculated for the new individuals. These two populations are merged with the initial
                population, and sorting is performed on this combined population once again. Next, the top n individuals
                from the merged population are selected to be carried over to the next generation. This process is
                repeated until the termination condition is met.

                In this study we used three different Fitness functions:
                <li> Accuracy</li>
                <li> Diversity (which discussed before)</li>
                <li> Imbalance Accuracy</li>

            <p>
                Next, we are going to discuss the Imbalance Accuracy, but before that, you can see the flowchart of the
                thesis.

            <h3>The proposed Accuracy measure (Imbalance Accuracy):</h3>
            <p>
                Consider the following dataset, which consists of samples X = {X1, X2, ..., X10} and three classes
                (a, b, c). The class of each sample is indicated in the corresponding column in the row below.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="26.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                Now consider classifier C, which predicts the classes of X samples according to the following table:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="27.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                Based on this, the accuracy value will be equal to:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="28.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                But to calculate the Imbalanced Accuracy measure, we need to create a similar table as the following,
                where
                each row corresponds to a class. Then, we will calculate the classifier's prediction accuracy using this
                table.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="29.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                According to the table above, it can be observed that classifier C has correctly predicted all six
                samples belonging to class "a", but it failed to predict any of the samples from class "c" correctly.
                However, the Accuracy measure for this classifier calculates an appropriate value of 70%. But the
                classifier's ability to predict class "c" is very weak, which the Accuracy measure cannot identify. This
                issue is known as the imbalance problem in classification in the literature.<br>

                If we denote the number of classes in the dataset as Numc, the total number of instances with the true
                class "ith" as Ri, and the number of instances from class "ith" that have been correctly predicted by
                classifier C as Ti, then the Imalanced Accuracy measure can be calculated using the following equation:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="30.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                Which is essentially the average classification accuracy across all
                classes or the average sensitivity across all classes. Based on this, the value of this measure for the
                given example would be:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="31.jpg" alt="Picture">
            </div>
            <p>
                Values close to 1 in this measure indicate that the evaluated classifier has a good performance in
                predicting all classes, while values close to 0 indicate poor performance in most classes. When this
                measure is equal to 0.5, it means that the evaluated classifier has perfect performance in at least one
                class, but poor performance in the rest of the classes. In binary classification problems, the value of
                this measure is equal to the AUC (Area Under the Curve) measure. However, in multi-class problems, these
                values differ from each other. Nevertheless, both the AUC and Imalanced Accuracy measures have a
                positive
                relationship with each other. Moreover, an increase in the value of this measure leads to an increase in
                the accuracy of the classifier. Based on the previous explanations, two proposed models in this research
                are implemented using the II-NSGA optimization algorithm and two different objective functions.

            <P>The figures below depict the individuals in the population across six different generations. Each
                individual represents an ensemble model consisting of a set of base classifiers randomly selected from
                the pool of base classifiers. The combination of these base classifiers is determined through majority
                voting, resulting in an ensemble classifier. The objective of the optimization algorithm in this
                research is to minimize the values of the objective functions.<br>

                The values of the objective functions are visualized in two dimensions. However, since the objective of
                the optimization algorithm in this research is minimization, we have designed the objective functions in
                a way that minimizing the objective function values is equivalent to maximizing the desired function.

                Different combinations of base classifiers lead to different ensemble models, where the classification
                accuracy and the diversity among the base classifiers forming each ensemble vary. In this research, we
                aim to find an ensemble model with the minimum classification error and the highest similarity among the
                base classifiers. The ensemble models that reside on the Pareto front, in fact, will be the most
                desirable ensemble models.<br>
                The figure below shows the ensemble models created in the last generation of the optimization algorithm.
                As can be seen in this figure, the created ensemble models are located in the best possible range in
                terms of the two objective functions: classification error and diversity. Based on this, although
                ensemble model A does not have desirable performance in terms of classification accuracy, the diversity
                among its base classifiers is close to 50%. On the other hand, ensemble model B has a desirable and
                close to 97% classification accuracy, and the diversity among its base classifiers is around 38%. In
                this research, for more accurate identification of churn customers, we have selected an ensemble model
                with better classification accuracy. Therefore, the MOEEC-1 model is essentially the same as ensemble
                model B.

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                In this research, two multi-objective evolutionary methods have been proposed for identifying churn
                customers. These methods generate a set of optimal ensemble models as a Pareto frontier. In the proposed
                method, the diversity objective function measures the diversity among classifiers based on their
                predictions of the evaluation dataset's classes. The proposed method creates different trained models by
                clustering the data and training base classifiers on each cluster. These base classifiers have different
                capabilities for identifying the test dataset's class, ensuring diversity among them. However, due to
                the diversity among these base classifiers, it is challenging to select an appropriate combination of
                them that can accurately predict the class of test samples by voting. Therefore, in this research, the
                proposed model uses multi-objective optimization methods to create different combinations of base
                classifiers at the Pareto frontier.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proposed models in this study can be utilized not only in the telecommunications industry but also
                in other industries to achieve reliable identification of churn customers. Some efforts towards
                improving the methods in this research include:</p>
            <li>Clustering: In this model, the number of clusters and the number of clustering iterations are
                important factors. Intelligent methods can be employed to determine the optimal number of
                iterations, reducing computational complexity in the model.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Optimization Algorithms: In this study, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) was
                used for multi-objective optimization. Other multi-objective optimization algorithms can be
                experimented with to further enhance the model's performance.
            </li>
            <p>These efforts aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed models, making them
                applicable in various industries for reliable churn customer identification.
