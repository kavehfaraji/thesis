            <h3>Overall Summary:</h3>
            <p> Based on the literature of customer churn research, it can be understood that the issue of predicting
                customer churn is vital for telecommunications companies. Predicting customer churn enables
                decision-makers to identify potential churners more quickly and make better decisions about them using
                appropriate strategies. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent model based on ensemble learning is
                proposed for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The research results
                demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the best predictive models in terms of customer
                churn prediction. If a decision-maker needs to determine which customers are likely to churn or not, the
                proposed algorithm can reliably predict customer churn. The computational achievement in this study is
                significant, as the proposed model outperforms other models in the majority of relevant indicators in
                the research literature. Additionally, the NCA method is utilized to reduce dimensions and identify the
                most effective features for classification. Furthermore, considering the challenges in creating ensemble
                models, the proposed model in this study is created by simultaneously considering two criteria,
                accuracy, and diversity, using the genetic algorithm optimization method with non-dominated sorting.
                Moreover, to address the issue of imbalance dataset, a performance evaluation index is suggested for
                classification, which considers the accuracy of classification in all classes. This index assists the
                optimization algorithm in selecting a set of classifiers capable of correctly classifying the available
                samples in all classes.To create diversity in classifiers and divide the training data, an incremental
                clustering method is utilized.</p>

            <p>This method causes the training set to be divided into diverse and dissimilar clusters. The
                incremental
                property of this clustering method allows the proposed model to examine all feature spaces. Firstly, the
                training set is divided into different clusters through clustering. Then, the identical clusters and
                clusters consisting of samples from a single class (atomic clusters) are removed. In the next step, five
                classifiers, namely Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
                k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB), are trained on the remaining clusters. Thus, a set of
                diverse base classifiers is obtained. Subsequently, using the NSGA-II optimization algorithm while
                considering two objectives, diversity and accuracy, a set of classifiers will be selected from the
                trained classifiers. These selected classifiers will have the highest level of diversity while being
                capable of accurately classifying the data. The novelty of this research lies in the utilization of new
                techniques such as collective learning and evolutionary computation to enhance the prediction accuracy
                in customer churn for the telecommunications industry. Additionally, the diversity evaluation index
                proposed in this research differs from the existing indices in the literature in terms of computational
                aspects. Previous indices measure the diversity of two classifiers based on their classification
                accuracy and error. However, the proposed index in this research evaluates diversity solely based on the
                difference between the predicted classes by the classifiers.

                The research utilizes a dataset extracted randomly from the database of an Iranian telecommunications
                company over a 12-month period. The dataset consists of a total of 3,150 records, each belonging to a
                customer, along with 12 feature columns. The dataset features include incomplete calls, number of
                complaints, duration of customer-operator communication, charged credit amount, duration of calls made,
                number of received calls, number of sent text messages, number of different contacted numbers, customer
                age, type of service plan used by the customer, and customer status.
                Furthermore, the dataset exhibits an imbalance with a churned customer ratio of 15.7%. The dataset is
                accessible in the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset">UCI</a>
                database.

            <h3>Multi-Objective Evolutionary Ensemble based on Clustering:</h3>
            <p>
                Diversity is a basic concept in the formation of ensemble classifications. To form an ensemble
                classification, a set of different and diverse classifiers is needed. Diversity metrics mentioned in the
                literature have a relationship with classification accuracy in terms of measuring the diversity
                of two classifiers based on the number of correctly predicted samples with prediction errors. These
                metrics compare the predictions of each classifier against the true class labels and measure the
                diversity of these comparisons. However, it should be noted that these metrics do not fully capture the
                actual difference between two classifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reason, the proposed model utilizes a novel method for evaluating diversity among base
                classifiers, which captures the difference between the predictions of two classifiers without
                considering classification accuracy. This approach ensures that increasing the value of this diversity
                index in an ensemble model does not lead to a decrease in classification accuracy. Therefore, there is
                no single solution that can simultaneously optimize both objectives, and instead, a set of solutions
                exists. These solutions are referred to as non-dominated or Pareto-optimal solutions. In the proposed
                method, using the II-NSGA algorithm and considering both diversity and accuracy metrics, a set of
                ensemble classifiers is created on the Pareto-optimal frontier.
            </p>
            <h3>The proposed diversity index.:</h3>
            <p>
                When we talk about the difference between two objects, we are essentially looking for characteristics or
                features that, although both objects possess them, differ in their type or value. For example, the
                difference between two tables could be the length of their legs, or the difference between two cats
                could be the variation in their fur color. However, when examining the difference between two
                classifiers, the only feature we can study to measure their dissimilarity is the type of class predicted
                by each classifier.<br>
                Suppose dataset X consists of seven samples, and the class set includes three classes {a,b,c}. The
                corresponding true classes for this dataset are as follows.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="1.jpg" alt="X dataset">
            </div>
            <p>
                Now, if the predictions of two classifiers, c1 and c2, for the samples of dataset X are as shown in the
                table below:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="2.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <p>
                In that case, the values of the following five diversity indices are calculated in the following order:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="3.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The Q statistic</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="4.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The correlation coefficient ρ:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="5.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The disagreement measure:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="6.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>The double-fault measure:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="7.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <h4>Interrater Agreement:</h4>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="8.jpg" alt="C1 and C2 classifiers predictions">
            </div>
            <p>
                Based on the calculations above, it can be concluded that none of the above diversity indices accurately
                capture the difference between the two classifiers. This is despite the fact that classifiers C1 and C2
                agree with each other on at least three sample predictions. Therefore, in the proposed
                method, an attempt has been made to calculate the difference between the two classifiers without
                considering the correctness or incorrectness of their predictions.Accordingly, a comparative function
                (f(x)) is used to measure the difference between the two
                classifiers, and the value of this function is calculated by the following equation:
