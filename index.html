            <p> Based on the literature of customer churn research, it can be understood that the issue of predicting
                customer churn is vital for telecommunications companies. Predicting customer churn enables
                decision-makers to identify potential churners more quickly and make better decisions about them using
                appropriate strategies. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent model based on collective learning is
                proposed for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The research results
                demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the best predictive models in terms of customer
                churn prediction. If a decision-maker needs to determine which customers are likely to churn or not, the
                proposed algorithm can reliably predict customer churn. The computational achievement in this study is
                significant, as the proposed model outperforms other models in the majority of relevant indicators in
                the research literature. Additionally, the NCA method is utilized to reduce dimensions and identify the
                most effective features for classification. Furthermore, considering the challenges in creating ensemble
                models, the proposed model in this study is created by simultaneously considering two criteria,
                accuracy, and diversity, using the genetic algorithm optimization method with non-dominated sorting.
                Moreover, to address the issue of imbalance dataset, a performance evaluation index is suggested for
                classification, which considers the accuracy of classification in all classes. This index assists the
                optimization algorithm in selecting a set of classifiers capable of correctly classifying the available
                samples in all classes.
