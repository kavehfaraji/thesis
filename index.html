            <h3>Overall Summary:</h3>
            <p> Based on the literature of customer churn research, it can be understood that the issue of predicting
                customer churn is vital for telecommunications companies. Predicting customer churn enables
                decision-makers to identify potential churners more quickly and make better decisions about them using
                appropriate strategies. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent model based on ensemble learning is
                proposed for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The research results
                demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the best predictive models in terms of customer
                churn prediction. If a decision-maker needs to determine which customers are likely to churn or not, the
                proposed algorithm can reliably predict customer churn. The computational achievement in this study is
                significant, as the proposed model outperforms other models in the majority of relevant indicators in
                the research literature. Additionally, the NCA method is utilized to reduce dimensions and identify the
                most effective features for classification. Furthermore, considering the challenges in creating ensemble
                models, the proposed model in this study is created by simultaneously considering two criteria,
                accuracy, and diversity, using the genetic algorithm optimization method with non-dominated sorting.
                Moreover, to address the issue of imbalance dataset, a performance evaluation index is suggested for
                classification, which considers the accuracy of classification in all classes. This index assists the
                optimization algorithm in selecting a set of classifiers capable of correctly classifying the available
                samples in all classes.To create diversity in classifiers and divide the training data, an incremental
                clustering method is utilized.</p>

            <p>This method causes the training set to be divided into diverse and dissimilar clusters. The
                incremental
                property of this clustering method allows the proposed model to examine all feature spaces. Firstly, the
                training set is divided into different clusters through clustering. Then, the identical clusters and
                clusters consisting of samples from a single class (atomic clusters) are removed. In the next step, five
                classifiers, namely Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
                k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB), are trained on the remaining clusters. Thus, a set of
                diverse base classifiers is obtained. Subsequently, using the NSGA-II optimization algorithm while
                considering two objectives, diversity and accuracy, a set of classifiers will be selected from the
                trained classifiers. These selected classifiers will have the highest level of diversity while being
                capable of accurately classifying the data. The novelty of this research lies in the utilization of new
                techniques such as collective learning and evolutionary computation to enhance the prediction accuracy
                in customer churn for the telecommunications industry. Additionally, the diversity evaluation index
                proposed in this research differs from the existing indices in the literature in terms of computational
                aspects. Previous indices measure the diversity of two classifiers based on their classification
                accuracy and error. However, the proposed index in this research evaluates diversity solely based on the
                difference between the predicted classes by the classifiers.

            <h3>Outline of the Dataset:</h3>
            <p>
                The research utilizes a dataset extracted randomly from the database of an Iranian telecommunications
                company over a 12-month period. The dataset consists of a total of 3,150 records, each belonging to a
                customer, along with 12 feature columns. The dataset features include incomplete calls, number of
                complaints, duration of customer-operator communication, charged credit amount, duration of calls made,
                number of received calls, number of sent text messages, number of different contacted numbers, customer
                age, type of service plan used by the customer, and customer status.
                Furthermore, the dataset exhibits an imbalance with a churned customer ratio of 15.7%. The dataset is
                accessible in the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset">UCI</a>
                database.
